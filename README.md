# Rust Learnings

I use this repo to gather some rust learnings.

# Get going
Navigate to any of the directories and that is one "project".

```bash
cargo add [dependency] # adds dependency to Cargo.toml requires: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

cargo build # installs dependencies and builds the repo, builds to target/debug/

cargo run -- --flags etc # build and run repo in dev mode.

./target/debug/[project_name] # run a built binary
```
